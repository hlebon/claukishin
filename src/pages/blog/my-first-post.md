## Primer titulo
Gatsby exposes a powerful Node.js API, which allows for functionality such as creating dynamic pages. This API is available in the gatsby-node.js file in the root directory of your project, at the same level as gatsby-config.js. Each export found in this file will be run by Gatsby, as detailed in its Node API specification. However, we only care about one particular API in this instance, createPages.
